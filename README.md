Blossom for OSM
==========

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/stekhn/blossom/master/img/blossom-munich.jpg)

Blossom is a set of styles for [OpenStreetMaps][]. It's based on
[OSM Bright][] and [Pandonia][]. The styles are all written in the beaufiful [Carto][] language. It can be used and edited in [TileMill][] as you please.

For a live setup I recommend the powerful [TileStream][] tile server. Those awesome maps are possible because of the many volunteers behind [OpenStreetMaps][]. Thank you guys!

Setup
-----

1. Get and install OSM Bright. You can use step 3 of [these instructions](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/) if you like.
2. Replace `base.mss`, `labels.mss`, `palette.mss`, and `roads.mss` with the Pandonia versions of those files.
3. Replace the `img` and `res` directories with the Pandonia versions.
4. Open TileMill and enjoy.
